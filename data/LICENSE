You agree to use the ASSETS only for purposes that are permitted by this Agreement and any applicable law or regulation in the relevant jurisdictions.

1. License.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the ASSETS, reproduce the ASSETS and prepare derivative works based on the ASSETS (“Derivative Works”), in each case solely for you to perform a trial or demonstration.

4. Feedback.

You may, but you are not obligated to, provide suggestions, requests, fixes, modifications, enhancements, or other feedback regarding the ASSETS (collectively, “Feedback”). Feedback, even if designated as confidential by you, will not create any confidentiality obligation for NVIDIA or its affiliates. If you provide Feedback, you hereby grant NVIDIA, its affiliates and its designees a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up and transferable license, under your intellectual property rights, to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, distribute (through multiple tiers of distribution), import, create derivative works of and otherwise commercialize and exploit the Feedback at NVIDIA’s discretion.

5. Term and Termination.

This Agreement expires twelve (12) months after the date of initial delivery or download of the ASSET.

Additionally, either party may terminate this Agreement at any time with prior written notice to the other party. Upon any termination, you must stop using and destroy all copies of the ASSETS and Derivative Works. Upon written request, you will certify in writing that you have complied with your commitments under this section. All provisions will survive termination, except for the licenses granted to you.
